After exploring the challenges of integrating AI with real-world tools like Google Calendar, I built this end-to-end calendar booking assistant as a hands-on solution.

It leverages LLMs to handle user prompts, interacts with the Google Calendar API to schedule events, and is deployed using a FastAPI + Streamlit stack.
The final product is a fully functional AI assistant â€” a smart and practical addition to any portfolio.
We also set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to the live site, ensuring fast, reliable updates with every push.

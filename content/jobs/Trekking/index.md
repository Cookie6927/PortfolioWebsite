- Passionate trekker with a love for exploring forts, forests, and mountains across India
- Completed iconic treks in Maharashtra including Rajgadâ€“Torna, Harishchandragad, Kalsubai Night Trek, and the 50 km Panhala to Pawankhind trail retracing Maratha history
- Ventured into the lush Western Ghats of Karnataka, with routes through Agumbe, Kudremukh, and Kodachadri
- Planning a Himalayan trek to trade Wi-Fi bars for mountain peaks - and maybe find stronger calves and some wisdom on the way!
- Trekking helps me disconnect, reconnect with myself, and push my physical and mental limits while exploring raw landscapes

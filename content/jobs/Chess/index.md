- Got into chess to level up focus, patience, and decision-making — plus, saying ‘checkmate’ feels way cooler than it should.
- Currently flexing a solid 900+ rapid rating and slowly climbing the ladder — blunders are just plot twists
- Enjoy analyzing games, falling into traps, and blaming the mouse slip like a true enthusiast
- Love the mix of logic and chaos that comes with every match, especially during 1 AM blitz sessions.
- Hit the link — let’s battle it out over a game of chess!

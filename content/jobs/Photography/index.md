- Capturing moments through my lens — from misty mountain trails to vibrant city chaos — with a love for storytelling through stills and motion
- Explored visual narratives via short travel films, nature photography, and event shoots, often obsessing over lighting and framing like a true camera nerd
- Always up for a shoot — whether it's golden hour portraits or documenting a trek, my camera’s usually the first thing I pack

- Left winger, constantly charging down the flank delivering crosses, cutting inside, and creating chances
- Represent teams up to the state level, with every match sharpening my instincts, speed, and spatial awareness
- Thrive on the pitch where communication, footwork, and quick decisions rule — the adrenaline is unmatched
- Football isn’t just a game for me, it’s a rhythm I move to — one sprint, one pass, and one goal at a time

- A lifelong learner who finds joy in understanding how things work — whether it’s a Salesforce flow or a psychological concept
- Passionate about storytelling, music, and late-night YouTube rabbit holes that start with tech and end with space documentaries
- Enjoy photographing landscapes and natural scenes — it’s my way of reconnecting with the outdoors
- Fascinated by automobiles — from classic bikes to modern cars, I love learning how they’re built and what makes them roar

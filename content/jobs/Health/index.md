- Started hitting the gym not just to lift weights, but to lift myself out of lazy routines and sluggish days
- Fell in love with the rhythm of consistency — early alarms, heavy sets, and the occasional "Why did I do legs today?" moment
- Learned that fitness isn’t just about six-packs or selfies — it’s about feeling stronger, clearer, and more alive
- Still figuring it all out, but now with better posture, meal prep, and a playlist that knows exactly when the beat should drop during that final rep
